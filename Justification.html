    <h1>Cat's Are Nobody's Tool</h1>
    <h3>Cause & Findings</h3>

      <p>
              
  My broad cause is “Why history matters to cats: Cats rule and dogs are tools”. The specific argument for this project 
  is cats domesticated themselves while dogs were made tools of humans early on.  My argument is based on the migration 
  routes of Homo sapiens (humans), Felis silvestris lybica (cats), and Canis familiaris (dogs) and their movement out of 
  Africa as well as the time frames for the development of various breeds of dogs in comparison to that of cats.
        
     </p>
     <p>
       
	Studies have noted that cats’ migration has mirrored that of humans and thus it must have been humans taking the animals 
  with them as they migrated as a way to control vermin around their crops (Baca). However, variation in the coloring of cats 
  did not change until the 1700s and the size of domesticated cats has remained consistent until modern times when humans started 
  to breed cats for their own aesthetic pleasure. 
       
    </p>
    <p>
      
	Dogs also mirrored human migration patterns, however, humans intervened early in the breeding of dogs to produce animals that 
  met the needs of the humans. Thus there is now a large variety of sizes, shapes, and colorings of dogs.
      
    </p>
    <p>
      
	With the data collected, I will argue that cats domesticated themselves and are nobody’s tool.

    <h3>Data Collected</h3>
    
    <p>
      
 	DNA migration patterns are computed using the mitochondrial molecular clock to process large amounts data and the differences 
  between samples of DNA. To avoid these large data sets and complex calculations, I have chosen truncated data sets that use 
  the macro-haplogroups to demonstrate migration across the globe and locations of early human remains (Soras, et al).
      
    </p>
    <p>
      
 	There is no agreement between breeder groups, national and international, on the number of breeds in existence. I have chosen 
  the data groups listed by Wikipedia for dogs and cats because they include all genetically recognized breeds (Ottoni, et al. & 
  Parker, et al.). In addition to this data, I have added the “founder” (cats) and “basal” (dogs) descriptors for cats and dogs 
  that are the breeds from which all others, currently in existence, spring. This information was listed in several of the resources.
      
    </p>
    <p>
      
	I also pulled a pet database created by Parkehi, et al. with images of the most popular breeds for possible use of photographs 
  in the final visualization. I chose a dataset which lists countries and their GSP longitude and latitude to create the needed 
  points for the map.
